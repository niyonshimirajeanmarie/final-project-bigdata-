## 📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting **agricultural crop yields** using machine learning models and visualizing the insights using Power BI. The main goal is to help farmers, agricultural planners, and policymakers make data-driven decisions to improve food production and resource efficiency.

---

## 🏷️ Sector
**Agriculture**

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

> Can we build a predictive model to estimate crop yield (in tonnes/hectare) based on environmental and farming practice variables such as soil type, temperature, rainfall, fertilizer usage, and irrigation?

---

## 📊 Dataset

- **Title:** Agriculture Crop Yield Dataset  
- **Source:** [Kaggle – Samuel Oti Attakorah](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelotiattakorah/agriculture-crop-yield)  
- **Structure:** Structured (CSV format)  
- **Rows/Columns:** ~1,000,000 rows × multiple features  
- **Status:** Requires preprocessing (cleaning missing values, handling outliers, encoding, etc.)

---

## 🐍 Python Tasks

The Python Jupyter Notebook includes:
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, formatting, outliers
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations, distributions
- Feature Engineering: Encoding categorical variables, scaling
- Model Building: Regression model (e.g., Random Forest)
- Model Evaluation: RMSE, R² Score, MAE
- Innovation: Feature importance analysis + custom function

---

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard

- Clear summary of the dataset and project findings  
- Interactive filters and slicers (e.g., by crop type, region)  
- Appropriate charts: bar, scatter, and line charts  
- Insightful recommendations and trends visualization  
- Innovation: DAX usage, tooltips, bookmarks

## 📁 Repository Structure


---

## 💡 Future Work

- Use ensemble learning (e.g., XGBoost or stacking)
- Integrate satellite or sensor data
- Deploy model as a web-based prediction tool
